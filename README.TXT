PROJECT TITLE: Bees and Bombs
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This is designed as a demo for a ~1hr High School class 
   to demonstrate Java Fundamentals
VERSION or DATE: 1.0.0
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run in Greenfoot
AUTHORS: Milo
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Use Arrow Keys to move, collect fruit, avoid bombs

This project features the absolute basics of Greenfoot, including a world and 3 distinct actors 
(only one of which is controllable).
The essential premise is to get kids interested in what Java can do by showing them how easy it is to
make a game that they can then use as a baseline for their own projects.

Running this will require Java to be installed.
Greenfoot is the software we use to actually run and develop the code, since it handles a lot of the "behind the scenes" stuff
for us. Install at https://www.greenfoot.org/download
